# Urban-Green-Space-Latin-America

Whether it’s smoothies, sports or hospitals – access to many things supporting health often is easier for people with more money. Even the availability of urban green space, which also has a great effect on mental and physical health, is influenced by income in many regions. But cities in Latin America have often been overlooked in the analysis of urban green spaces, even though it is one of the most urbanised regions of the world. Over 80 percent of people in the region live in urban areas – only North America has a higher rate of urbanisation. 

In this data analysis I am taking a look at the four most populous countries of the Americas and the urban green spaces in their metropoles: São Paulo, Mexico City, Buenos Aires and Bogota.

I used reverse geocoding and QGIS to create the maps that show a possible linkage between urban green space and income. In this notebook you'll mostly see the reverse geocoding.
